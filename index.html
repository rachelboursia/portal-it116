<p>     
    Hello World! My name is Rachel Boursia, and I am currently working towards an application development & testing certification at Seattle Central College with the Year Up program. I am looking forward to working in the tech industry that promotes my creativity, design, and problem-solving skills. I am also a natural leader, which is essential because the tech industry deserves more representation from people who look like me.
</p>
<p>
    This website is an assignment for my IT116 course, and I have built a portal page. I will link a couple of other assignments I am proud of; they both were completed in my IT116 course. The first assignment I linked is my Stylin with CSS assignment. The second assignment I linked is my Explore Oregon assignment 
</p>
<p>     
    My career goal in the tech industry is to become a gaming software developer. I have always had a passion for video games. From my experience, while playing different video games growing up, I notice a lack in the women's perspective in video games. For example, little things like not until the Halo Reach story mode could the primary player have the option to be female. 

    I want to help bring other perspectives to video games!
</p>
<p>
    The games I currently play now are listed below: 
    <ol>
        <li>Grand Theft Auto</li>
        <li>Call of Duty</li>
        <li>Dayz</li>
    </ol>
<p>     

    Please feel free to contact me on my GitHub and my LinkedIn.
